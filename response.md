Jaegar is a tool that can be used to observe the behavior of a particular microservice in large-scale applications that are built behind a microservice-oriented architecture. It provides a "traceback" of a request that was used in an application and can show developers where they may be bottlenecks in an API's performance for instance. In a microservice-oriented application, sometimes a request involves multiple microservices so having a traceback can show where a request failed or bottlenecked. In the screenshot, we can see that Jaegar is providing information about an HTTP GET request that we performed within our small backend. It is showing us the time when the trace started, how long the trace started, the number of microservices involved, and the number of spans. Spans represent individual segments of the request processing, providing insights into different parts of the system. Additionally it shows information about the request that was actually sent including the host involved, HTTP method, the status code of the request, and the actual target of the request. From the trace, we can see that the service that was involved in the HTTP GET request was todo-service which we implemented inside of the index.js file which will return all of the information that is inside of the database. We see that the request involved one service, lasted around 34 milliseconds, and spanned over 3 segments. If we had done an HTTP GET request where we specified a specific id number, then Jaegar would update to reflect the new request and the information associated with the request.
